## Reflections and Comments

As an adult learner no matter the subject, the best thing is that you know the people in the "seats" want to be there. Another thing about adult learners, is they have a goal in mind so they are invested in their learning and even putting in time out of class to learn material to get further in their career or other goals in mind. I am planning my learning by taking time out outside of class to research and practice and learn more because I am invested in my future. I record or measure my learning by reflecting on where I started and measuring what I know now and what I am capable of. I will evaluate what I want to learn week to week in this learning setting but honestly any time I start to feel complacent, I will start to think of what else I can do to expand my knowledge.  

I think although I donâ€™t have any tech experience that I have picked up a lot of skills from other jobs such as: learning communication and networking in the military and honestly with all my other jobs I learned about myself that I pick up on things very fast and I believe all that will help me succeed in my training as well in my career.

My motivations for learning coming from 3 specific things: My love for tech. I really do love all things computers and tech. I finally found something I love and am excited to learn about. The second thing is the potential of money that I can make in this field which brings me to my third reason: my family and daughter that I want to be able to take care of and provide for.
